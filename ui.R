The Mann-Whitney U Test is a non-parametric test that works well with ordinal data. This test compares the medians of two different groups to test if they appear to come from the same population. Our burn severity data was obtained from the MTBS dataset, which contains calculated burn severity values for fires that have occurred in California since 1984. The value can be 2 (low), 3 (moderate), or 4 (high). The burn severity value used in this analysis was calculated by taking the mode, or most common, burn severity for each 30 meter cell in California between 1984 and 2021. "),
