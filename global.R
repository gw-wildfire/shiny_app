To statistically compare the distribution of burn severities between GDEs and non-GDEs, a Mann-Whitney U test was conducted. The resulting p-value from this test was 0.375. Based on this value, the study concluded that there is insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis, which states that there is no significant difference in the distribution of burn severity values between GDEs and non-GDEs in the Southern California Mountains ecoregion. Therefore, the analysis suggests that the burn severity distributions in these two groups are similar in this ecoregion."
